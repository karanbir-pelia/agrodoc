# ðŸŒ± AgroDoc - Crop Disease Recognition System

## Overview

AgroDoc is a web application designed to help farmers detect and manage plant diseases early and accurately. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system analyzes images of plant leaves to identify diseases, providing timely insights that can help protect crop yields and ensure food security.

## Features

-   **Disease Recognition**: Upload images of plant leaves to detect and classify diseases
-   **Comprehensive Database**: Supports multiple crops and their associated diseases
-   **Remedial Measures**: Provides guidance on how to treat identified plant diseases
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use

## Supported Crops

The system currently supports disease detection for the following crops:

-   Apple
-   Bell Pepper
-   Blueberry
-   Cherry
-   Corn
-   Grape
-   Orange
-   Peach
-   Potato
-   Raspberry
-   Soybean
-   Squash
-   Strawberry
-   Tomato
